# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI agents when working with code in this repository.

## ðŸ“š Onboarding

At the start of each session, read:
1. `README.md` - Project overview, tech stack, and quick start guide
2. `README.SETUP.md` - Complete setup instructions and environment configuration
3. `README.DEVELOPMENT.md` - Development commands, testing, code quality, and deployment
4. `README.ARCHITECTURE.md` - Project structure, authentication system, and API reference

## âœ… Quality Gates

When writing code, you must not finish until all of these succeed:

1. `pnpm worker:test run` - All API tests pass
2. `pnpm format` - Code is properly formatted with Biome
3. `pnpm lint` - All linting rules pass
4. TypeScript compilation succeeds (no type errors)

If any check fails, fix the issues and run checks again.

## Coding Guidance

- Do not read the entirety of worker-configuration.d.ts. These files are large and blow up your context window. Instead grep them or read them piece by piece

- To run tests use "pnpm worker:test run" (not just "pnpm test") - this runs vitest once and exits

- In vitest if you need to check if something is defined and you're then planning to check any further things there - use assert() call from vitest as opposed to expect(<thing>).toBeDefined(). This will prevent any type errors

- You should almost never add Cloudflare Bindings directly as a type. First see if they can be generated from the .dev.vars or the wrangler configuration file (using `pnpm cf-typegen`)
